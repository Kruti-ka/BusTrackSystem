 Project aims to create a real-time GPS tracking system that captures location data using a GPS module and an ESP32 microcontroller, sends this data to Firebase Realtime Database, and visualizes the location on a web-based interface using Google Maps API. The system workflow ensures that location data is continuously updated and accurately displayed on a map in real-time
